                                                <p>Accrued revenue does not immediately affect cash flow. It is recorded

                                                    without immediate cash inflow. Although it can temporarily enhance a
                                                    company's financial position, excessive reliance on accrued revenue
                                                    without subsequent cash receipts poses long-term sustainability
                                                    risks.

                                                    Timely cash inflows are vital for liquidity, ongoing operations, and
                                                    growth. Businesses should monitor cash flow alongside accrued
                                                    revenue to maintain adequate liquidity, fulfil obligations, and
                                                    sustain operations effectively. Striking a balance ensures financial
                                                    stability and long-term success.

                                                <p>Accrued sales and deferred sales are two vital concepts in financial
                                                    management that play distinct roles. While they share a connection,
                                                    they are also opposites in nature.
                                                    <br>
                                                    Accrued revenue refers to income that has been earned by a company
                                                    but has not yet been received in cash or recorded on an invoice.
                                                    This situation may arise when goods or services have been delivered,
                                                    but invoices have not been issued. In such cases, the revenue is
                                                    recognized even though payment has not been received.
                                                    <br>
                                                    On the other hand, deferred revenue represents income received from
                                                    sales transactions before the goods or services have been delivered.
                                                    This commonly occurs when customers make advance payments for
                                                    products or services that will be provided at a later date. The
                                                    funds received are recorded as deferred revenue until the delivery
                                                    of goods or services takes place, allowing the income to be
                                                    recognized as revenue.
