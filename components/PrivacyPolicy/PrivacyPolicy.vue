        </p>

        <h6>Data Storage and Security</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The data we store is protected by industry-standard organizational and
          technical safeguards. Even though we take precautions to safeguard
          your information, we cannot guarantee that information transmitted
          over the Internet, stored on our systems, or otherwise in our care
          will be completely secure from outside intrusion. This is because no
          security system is completely secure.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          You, not DealDox Software, are responsible for securing the storage
          and access to the information you enter into our server or data center
          services. Users of servers or data centers should configure SSL to
          restrict access to the databases and other storage locations used and
          to prevent the interception of information sent over networks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
          DealDox Software follows a policy where they don't store your data
          longer than they need to. When you buy something, they keep
          information about your purchase to complete your order. Then, they
          keep it for a while longer in case you have any questions or problems.
          If you stop using their service, they will either delete your
          information or make it anonymous after 7 years.
        </p>

        <h4>Access and Control Your Data</h4>

        <h6>GDPR Data Your Rights</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
          You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to
          our use of it (including for marketing purposes), to have it deleted
          or restricted, or to receive it in an organized electronic format. You
          may first need to get in touch with that service to get help with your
          requests. For all other requests, please contact us using the
          information in the Contact Us section below.
        </p>

        <p class="text-justify">
          In some cases, your request and options may be limited: for instance,
          if granting your request would reveal information about another
          individual or if we or your administrator are required by law or have
          compelling legitimate reasons to keep the information. If you have
          asked us to share your data with third parties, such as by installing
          third-party apps, you will need to get in touch with those third-party
          service providers directly to have your data deleted or restricted in
          some other way. You may be able to file a complaint with a data
          protection authority in the nation in which you live, and work, or
          believe your rights have been violated if you have unresolved
          concerns.
        </p>

        <h6>Request to stop using your information</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
          Sometimes, you might request that we quit getting to, putting away,
          utilizing and in any case handling your data where you accept, we
          don't have the proper freedoms to do as such. You can, for instance,
          request that we delete your Services account by this policy if you
          believe it was created for you without your permission or if you are
          no longer an active user. You could contact us to withdraw your
          consent to use your information for a limited purpose if you gave it
          to us, but this will not change any processing that was already taking
          place at the time. By contacting us as outlined below, you can also
          opt out of our use of your information for marketing purposes. When
          you make such requests, we might need some time to investigate them
          and help you.

        <h6>Opt-Out</h6>
        <p class="text-justify">
          You can unsubscribe from receiving promotional communications from us
          by updating your email preferences in your Service account settings
          menu, using the unsubscribe link in each email, or by contacting us as

          registration database or promotional email list. You will continue to
          receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services even
          after you opt out of receiving promotional messages. In your account
